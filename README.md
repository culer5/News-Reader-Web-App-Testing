## Synopsis

This is project 6 of the Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree. I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I was required to use the Jasmine testing suite.
## Process

Source code to be tested was placed in the src subfolder as .js files. Testing code using Jasmine was placed in the spec subfolder as .js files. Jasmine library was placed in the lib folder.

## Motivation

According to Kent Beck's book Test-Driven Development by Example, TDD is a technique expressed through the repetition of the following steps: add a test, run all the tests and see if the new one fails, write some code necessary to pass the tests, run the tests, and refactor the code.

This process aims to produce better code by writing the tests first. Developers are forced to think about testability from the very beginning. This also leads to a better understanding of the functional and nonfunctional requirements.
